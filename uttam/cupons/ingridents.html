          <h2>Ingredient choices and how we make them</h2>
          <p>
            Some people believe natural product ingredients are safer to use
            than man-made, synthetic ones. The reality is that it’s not that
            simple; both natural and synthetic ingredients have a safe range and
            an unsafe range. Even basics like sunlight, oxygen, and water have
            safety limits. So what goes into choosing our product ingredients?

              <a href="">the safe range for every ingredient</a>, whether
              natural or synthetic. Then we apply the same science-based

            <h2>3<span>.</span> Sustainable Sourcing</h2>
            <p>
              Synthetic ingredients can oftentimes be more sustainable than
              natural ingredients because they require fewer resources.
              Sustainable features of a product ingredient depend on the
              resources used in creating it, harvesting it, making the product
              and then ultimately using the product. And we’re also doing the
              legwork to ensure we use the most
              <a href="">sustainable and earth-friendly solutions.</a>

        <h2>Understanding common ingredients</h2>
        <p>
          Even though we ensure our products are safe to use before they hit
          shelves, we know there’s a lot of <br />conversation around certain
          product ingredients. Here's our point of view:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ingredient-content-3">
        <div class="left-3">
          <div class="ingd-decs">
            <h3>1,4-Dioxane</h3>
            <p>
              1,4-dioxane is not an ingredient, but rather a by-product that can
              form in tiny (trace) amounts when making a variety of ingredients
              in some cleaning products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Importantly, the presence of 1,4-dioxane in our products is
              already well below established safe limits and is in compliance
              with all government requirements. For example, if you washed and
              wore over 1,000 loads of laundry every day, you’d still be below
              the safe limit for 1,4-dioxane.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re continually working to reduce and/or eliminate it while
              still delivering the performance we all expect.

            <h3>Phthalates</h3>
            <p>
              You may have heard general safety questions about phthalates.
              There are several types of phthalates and each one is different
              (much like there are safe and unsafe types of mushrooms). We
              comply with all phthalate bans globally. In fact, we have removed
              the only phthalate that was used in our product fragrances even
              though agencies found it to be safe.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="ingd-decs">
            <h3>Microbeads and Microplastics</h3>
            <p>
              Microbeads are solid plastic particles of 5 mm or less and are
              used to exfoliate or cleanse in personal care products
            </p>
            <p>
              We previously included microbeads in some of our exfoliating
              cleansing products and toothpastes based on positive feedback from
              people who use them. Because microbeads are made from plastic,
              certain groups have questioned whether plastic found in our oceans
              and waterways is from microbeads. The science to date shows the
              breakdown of larger plastics to be the primary source of plastics
              in the ocean, not microbeads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we have removed microbeads from all P&G facial/body cleansers
              and toothpaste formulas, so today the products we are
              manufacturing are microbead-free.

            <h3>Phosphates</h3>
            <p>
              Phosphates are essential nutrients for plant growth and a healthy
              ecosystem, and are commonly found in fertilizers. While phosphate
              is naturally present in the environment, it can also be released
              in much.
            </p>
            <p>
              We developed a series of product innovations to produce many
              effective, phosphate-free cleaning products without a compromise
              in cleaning performance. Therefore, we’ve removed phosphates from
              over 95% of our cleaning products already—and are working to
              eliminate the remaining 5% from our consumer products over the
              next few years. In the few instances we continue to use
              phosphates, we are in compliance with all applicable regulatory
              limits.

            <h3>Triclosan and Triclorcarban</h3>
            <p class="p1">
              Triclosan and triclocarban are antimicrobial ingredients that slow
              or stop the growth of germs such as bacteria and mildew. We have
              already eliminated triclosan from our products globally and have
              an exit plan for our few remaining uses of triclocarban.

            <h3>Fragrance Ingredients</h3>
            <p>
              Fragrances are naturally all around us and create a range of
              sensations and can make your daily routine enjoyable. Our product
              fragrances are blended with the utmost care and greatest attention
              to safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not use many common food allergens in our fragrances,
              including Egg Derivatives, Milk Derivatives, Gluten, Barley, Rye,
              Soy Derivatives, Fish or Shellfish. In total, we exclude over 170
              ingredients from our fragrances—more exclusive than the list of
              ingredients banned by the International Fragrance Association.
              Additional information about the fragrance ingredients we use in
              our products can be found for most items in the U.S. and Canada on
