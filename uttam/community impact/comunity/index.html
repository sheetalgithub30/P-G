              Vicks launched the third edition of its #TouchOfCare campaign on
              National Doctor’s Day to honor the sacrifice and determination of
              healthcare and frontline heroes during this pandemic. The powerful
              film brought to life the inspiring story of Late Dr. Dnyaneshwar
              Bhosale and the sacrifices he made while ensuring that many less
              fortunate children received life-saving medical attention during
              the pandemic.

              In 2015, our brand Gillette launched the ‘Safalta’ program with

              youth in the age group 18-24 years. The #GilletteSafaltaMutthiMein
              program aims to help the youth eliminate this barrier and be job
              ready, by providing them best-in-class soft-skills and grooming
              training. During the pandemic induced lockdown, we adopted a
              hybrid approach and continued delivering the training through
              videoconferences as well as in-class sessions with limited
              seating, maintaining the social distancing protocols. Since the
              inception of the program, we have trained over 5 million students
              across 15 geographies in the country.

        <h3>Donated 20 lakh+ masks and hand sanitizers produced in-house</h3>
        <p>
          In the wake of the pandemic, we installed additional capacity at our
          manufacturing sites in India to produce masks for safeguarding our
          employees and assisting the frontline warriors. We distributed over 20
          lakh masks and bottles of hand sanitizer in partnership with
          government and relief authorities.

        <h3>Donated 3.8 lakh+ sanitary napkins to communities in need.</h3>
        <p>
          Our products play an important part in catering to the health and
          hygiene needs of the communities we serve in. Since the outbreak of
          the pandemic, we have distributed over 38 lakh Whisper sanitary pads
          to women and girls from underprivileged and migrant communities across
          the country, in partnership with government and relief organizations.
        </p>
        <h3>Contributed towards expanding hospital capacity</h3>
        <p>
          Together with TATA Trusts, we upgraded and expanded hospital
          capacities across 14 hospitals in the country. This initiative aimed
          to support and enhance urgent healthcare facilities to not only meet
          immediate health needs, but also lay ground for the long-term needs of
          the communities. The hospitals have been equipped with critical care
          capabilities, radiological equipment, life-saving essential machines
          like ventilators and more. Further, we also donated 100 oxygen
          concentrators to local authorities to support their fight against the
          pandemic.

          Vaccines play a critical role in containing the spread of the virus.
          To support the government’s inoculation efforts, we contributed INR 50
          Crore towards 10 lakh vaccine doses for 5 lakh citizens, to 20+ state
          governments. In addition, we also facilitated vaccination drives for
          our 5000+ employees in India and their family members.
